### About

We provide the complete [src/main.ipynb](https://github.com/toygarr/save-the-kid/blob/main/src/main.ipynb) outputs to make the results of our study more transparent, even though we are unable to directly provide the dataset.<br/>
Figures are generated in both .pdf and .png formats.

* In each training case, file names are given as: *tumorTypes_randomState*
* All cases have entire confusion matrices for eight different ML models, and are given as: *tumorTypes_matrix*
* All cases have entire feature importance figures for eight different ML models, and are given as: *tumorTypes_FeatureImportances* or *tumorTypes_impTable* depending on if the model has embedded feature_importances_ function or requires additional function.
